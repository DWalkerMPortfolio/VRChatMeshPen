This repository is a fully-networked 3D pen system for VRChat developed in Unity. It features multiple colors, no cap on the number of lines drawn, and per-pixel erasing. It was originally developed for Meetspace VR, a project by Michigan State University's GEL and SPARTIE labs and is reproduced here with permission.

The left and right sides of the GIF below are separate VRChat clients both running on the same local machine.
